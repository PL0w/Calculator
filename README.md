###### Insight
I realize writing a simple calculator requires a little more brain power than I initially thought. Nothing too complex.
For example, we do not know the amount of numbers in an equation. (5 + 5), (5 + 5 + 5), (5 / 2 + 3 + etc), therefore, take into account what has been entered and have yet to be entered.
